            These Strawberry Jam Filled Cheesecake Bars are my take on 
            the nostalgic Philadelphia Cream Cheese Cheesecake Bars that 
            I adored as a kid! Although they were sadly discontinued, 
            this recreation has the same creamy, dreamy flavor with 
            homemade strawberry jam and a drizzle of white chocolate 
            but EVEN BETTER. Trust me, each bite is a trip down memory lane!

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <h3>Prepare The Crust</h3>
            
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, 
                melted butter, and granulated sugar. Mix until the 
                crumbs are evenly moistened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared 
                baking pan to form an even layer. Use the bottom of a 
                measuring cup or a flat object to pack it tightly.
            </li>
            
            <h3>Make The Cheesecake Filling:</h3>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C) and line a 9x9-inch square 
                baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy 
                removal.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, beat the room-temperature cream cheese until 
                smooth and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the granulated sugar and flour, and mix until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the sour cream, heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt 
                until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each 
                addition until just combined. Do not overmix.
            </li>
            <h3>Bake The Crust</h3>
            
            <li>
                Pour the cheesecake filling over the crust, spreading it evenly 
                with a spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the center is set but still 
                slightly jiggly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn off the oven, crack the oven door open, and let the 
                cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour to prevent cracking.
            </li>
            <li>
                After 1 hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it 
                cool to room temperature. Then, refrigerate for at least 4 
                hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <h3>Make The Stawberry Jam:</h3>
            <li>
                While the cheesecake is chilling, combine the diced strawberries
                , granulated sugar, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the 
                strawberries break down and the mixture thickens to a jam-like 
                consistency, about 15-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and let the jam cool completely.
            </li>
            <h3>Assemble The cheesecake Bars:</h3>
            <li>
                Once the cheesecake is fully chilled, remove it from the pan 
                using the parchment paper overhang and place it on a cutting 
                board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the cheesecake into rectangular bars.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a sharp knife, carve out a small strip from the center 
                of each bar, being careful not to go all the way through the 
                cheesecake.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill the carved out strip with the cooled strawberry jam.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, 
                microwaving in 30-second intervals and stirring until 
                smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle the melted white chocolate over the top of each bar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the bars set for a few minutes to allow the white 
                chocolate to harden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the strawberry jam-filled cheesecake bars chilled and 
                enjoy!
            </li>
