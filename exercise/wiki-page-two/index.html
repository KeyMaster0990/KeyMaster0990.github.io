                Development began in 1994, originally for the Super Nintendo 
                Entertainment System. After delays and technical difficulties 
                from experimenting with several platforms, most notably the 
                Nintendo 64, Square moved production to the PlayStation, 
                largely 
                due to the advantages of the CD-ROM format. 
                Veteran Final Fantasy 
                staff returned, including series creator and producer 
                Hironobu 
                Sakaguchi, director Yoshinori Kitase, and composer Nobuo 
                Uematsu. 
                The title was the first in the series to use full motion video 
                and 
                3D computer graphics, featuring 3D character models superimposed 
                over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Although the gameplay remained 
                mostly unchanged from previous entries, Final Fantasy VII 
                introduced more widespread science fiction elements and a more 
                realistic presentation. The combined development and marketing 
                budget amounted to approximately US$80 million.

                Final Fantasy VII received widespread commercial and critical 
                success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title, 
                and it is 
                regarded as one of the greatest and most influential video 
                games 
                ever made. The title won numerous Game of the Year awards and
                 was 
                acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and 
                popularizing Japanese role-playing games worldwide. Critics 
                praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some 
                criticism was directed towards the original English 
                localization. 
                Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a 
                multimedia subseries called the Compilation of 
                Final Fantasy VII, 
                and a high definition remake trilogy currently comprising 
                Final Fantasy VII Remake (2020), 
                and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (2024).

            <i>See also: Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series § 
                Gameplay</i>
            <p>
                The gameplay of Final Fantasy VII is similar to earlier Final 
                Fantasy titles and Japanese role-playing games.[1] The game 
                features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the 
                battle screen.[2][3]: 15, 20  At its grandest scale, players 
                explore the world of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map.[4] 
                The world map contains representations of areas for the player 
                to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins.[5] Natural 
                barriers—such as mountains, deserts, and bodies of water—block 
                access by foot to some areas; as the story progresses, 
                the player receives vehicles that help traverse these 
                obstacles, thus opening more of the game world for 
                exploration.[3]: 44  Chocobos can be found in certain spots 
                on the map and, if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible 
                on foot or by vehicle.[3]: 46  In field mode, the player 
                navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on 
                the world map.[4] VII marks the first time in the series that 
                the mode is represented in a three-dimensional space. In this 
                mode, the player can explore the environment, talk with 
                characters, advance the story, and initiate event games.
                [3]: 15  Event games are short minigames that use special 
                control functions and are often tied to the story.[3]: 18  
                While in field mode, the player can also make use of shops 
                and inns. Shops allow the player to buy and sell items that 
                can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and 
                accessories. Inns restore the hit points and mana points of 
                characters who rest at them and cure abnormalities 
                contracted during battles.[3]: 17 
            </p>
            <p>
                At random intervals on the world map and in field mode, and at
                specific moments in the story, the game will enter the battle
                screen, which places the player characters on one side and the 
                enemies on the other. It employs an "Active Time Battle" (ATB) 
                system, in which the characters exchange moves until one side 
                is defeated.[1][2] The damage or healing dealt by either side 
                is quantified on screen. Characters have several statistics 
                that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, 
                hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic 
                determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each 
                character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's 
                gauge is full, the player can input a command for them to 
                perform. The commands change as the game progresses, and are 
                dependent on the characters in the player's party and on the 
                abilities, spells, etc., the player has added to their 
                equipment. Commands include attacking with a weapon, casting 
                magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions 
                that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. 
                Final Fantasy VII also features powerful, character-specific 
                commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a 
                special gauge is charged by taking enemy attacks. After being 
                attacked, characters can be afflicted by one or more abnormal 
                "statuses", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and 
                their adverse effects can be removed by special items or 
                abilities or by resting at an inn. Once all enemies are 
                defeated, the battle ends and the player is rewarded with 
                money, items, and experience points. If the player is defeated, 
                it is game over and the game must be loaded from the last save 
                point.[3]: 20–27 When not in battle, the player can use the 
                menu screen, where they can review each character's status 
                and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, 
                save the game when on the world map or at a save point, and 
                manage orbs called Materia. Materia are the main method of 
                customizing characters in Final Fantasy VII, and can be added 
                to equipment to provide characters with new magic spells, 
                monsters to summon, commands, statistical upgrades, and 
                other benefits.[6] Materia level up through their own 
                experience point system and can be combined to create 
                different effects.[3]: 30–42

            <p>
                Final Fantasy VII takes place on a world referred to in-game 
                as the "Planet" and retroactively named "Gaia".[7][8] 
                The planet's lifeforce, called the Lifestream, is a flow of 
                spiritual energy that gives life to everything on the Planet; 
                its processed form is known as "Mako".[9] On a societal and 
                technological level, the game has been defined as an industrial 
                or post-industrial science fiction setting.[10] During 
                Final Fantasy VII, the Shinra Electric Power Company, a 
                world-dominating megacorporation headquartered in the city 
                of Midgar, is draining the Planet's Lifestream for energy, 
                weakening the Planet and threatening its existence and 
                all life.[11] Significant factions within the game include 
                AVALANCHE, an eco-terrorist group seeking Shinra's downfall 
                so the Planet can recover;[8] the Turks, a covert branch of 
                Shinra's security forces;[12] SOLDIER, an elite Shinra 
                fighting force created by enhancing humans with Mako;[13] 
                and the Cetra, a near-extinct human tribe which maintains a 
                strong connection to the Planet and the Lifestream.[14] 
                The main protagonist is Cloud Strife, an aloof mercenary who 
                claims to be a former 1st Class SOLDIER. Early on, he works 
                with two members of AVALANCHE: Barret Wallace, its brazen but 
                fatherly leader; and Tifa Lockhart, a shy yet nurturing 
                martial artist and his childhood friend. During their journey, 
                they meet Aerith Gainsborough, a carefree flower merchant and 
                one of the last surviving Cetra;[14][15] Red XIII, an 
                intelligent quadruped from a tribe that protects the 
                planet;[16] Cait Sith, a fortune-telling robotic cat 
                controlled by repentant Shinra staff member Reeve;[3][17] 
                and Cid Highwind, a pilot whose dream of being the first human 
                in outer space was unrealized.[18] The group can also recruit 
                Yuffie Kisaragi, a young ninja and skilled Materia thief; and 
                Vincent Valentine, a former Turk and victim of Shinra's 
                experiments.[19] The game's main antagonists are Rufus Shinra, 
                the son of President Shinra and the later leader of the Shinra 
                Corporation;[20] Sephiroth, a former SOLDIER who reappears 
                several years after being presumed dead;[3] and Jenova, a 
                hostile extraterrestrial life-form who the Cetra 
                imprisoned 2,000 years ago and who Sephiroth was created 
                from.[21][22][23] A key character in Cloud's backstory is 
                Zack Fair, a member of SOLDIER and Aerith's first love.[24]
            </p>
            <h2 id="p4">Plot</h2>
            <p>
                AVALANCHE destroys a Shinra Mako reactor in Midgar, but an 
                attack on another reactor goes wrong and Cloud falls into the 
                city's slums. There, he meets Aerith and protects her from 
                Shinra.[25][26] Meanwhile, Shinra finds AVALANCHE's base of 
                operations and intentionally collapses part of the upper city 
                level in retaliation for the Mako reactor being destroyed, 
                killing many AVALANCHE members and innocent bystanders as 
                collateral damage.[27] Aerith is also captured since Shinra 
                believes that as a Cetra, she can potentially reveal the 
                "Promised Land", which they believe is overflowing with 
                Lifestream energy they can exploit.[28][29] Cloud, Barret, 
                and Tifa rescue Aerith, and during their escape from Midgar, 
                discover that Sephiroth murdered President Shinra despite 
                being presumed dead five years earlier.[30] The party pursues 
                Sephiroth across the Planet, with now-President Rufus on their 
                trail; they are soon joined by the rest of the playable 
                characters. At a Cetra temple, Sephiroth reveals he intends 
                to use a powerful magical artifact known as "Black Materia" 
                to cast the spell "Meteor", which would have a devastating 
                impact on the Planet. Sephiroth claims he will absorb the 
                Lifestream as it attempts to heal the wound caused by Meteor, 
                and become a god-like being in the process.[31] 
                The party retrieves the Black Materia, but Sephiroth 
                manipulates Cloud into surrendering it. Aerith departs 
                alone to stop Sephiroth and follows him to an abandoned 
                Cetra city. While Aerith prays to the Planet for help, 
                Sephiroth attempts to force Cloud to kill her; after this 
                fails, he kills her himself before fleeing, leaving the 
                White Materia behind.[32] The party then learns of Jenova, 
                a hostile alien lifeform who landed on the Planet two 
                thousand years prior to the game's events. Upon arrival 
                on the Planet, Jenova began infecting the Cetra with a 
                virus, and they were nearly wiped out. However, a small 
                group managed to seal away Jenova in a tomb, which Shinra 
                later unearthed. At Nibelheim, Jenova's cells were used in 
                experiments which led to the creation of Sephiroth.[21][32] 
                Five years before the game's events, Sephiroth and Cloud 
                visited Nibelheim, where Sephiroth learned of his origins 
                and was driven insane as a result. He murdered the 
                townspeople, and then vanished after Cloud confronted him.
                At the Northern Crater, the party learns that the "Sephiroths" 
                they have encountered are Jenova clones who the insane Shinra 
                scientist Hojo created. Cloud confronts the real Sephiroth as 
                he is killing his clones to reunite Jenova's cells, but is 
                again manipulated into giving him the Black Materia. 
                Sephiroth then taunts Cloud by showing another SOLDIER in his 
                place in his memories of Nibelheim, suggesting that Cloud is a 
                failed clone of Sephiroth.[33] Sephiroth summons Meteor and 
                seals the Crater as Cloud falls into the Lifestream and Rufus 
                captures the party. After escaping Shinra, the party discovers 
                Cloud at an island hospital in a catatonic state from Mako 
                poisoning, and Tifa decides to stay as his caretaker. When a 
                planetary defense force called Weapon attacks the island, the 
                two fall into the Lifestream,[34] where Tifa helps Cloud 
                reconstruct his memories. Cloud was a mere infantryman who
                was never accepted into SOLDIER; the SOLDIER in his memories 
                was his friend Zack. At Nibelheim, Cloud ambushed and wounded 
                Sephiroth after the latter's mental breakdown, but Jenova 
                preserved Sephiroth's life. Hojo experimented on Cloud and 
                Zack for four years, injecting them with Jenova's cells 
                and Mako. They managed to escape, but Zack was killed in 
                the process. The trauma of these events triggered an identity
                crisis in Cloud, and he constructed a false persona based 
                around Zack's stories and his own fantasies.[32][35] Cloud 
                accepts his past and reunites with the party, who learn that 
                Aerith's prayer to the Planet had been successful: the Planet 
                had attempted to summon Holy to prevent Meteor's impact, but 
                Sephiroth prevented it from having any effect. Shinra fails to 
                destroy Meteor, but manages to defeat a Weapon and puncture 
                the Northern Crater, seemingly killing Rufus and several other 
                personnel. After killing Hojo, who is revealed to be 
                Sephiroth's biological father,[21] the party descends 
                to the Planet's core through the opening in the Northern Crater
                and defeats both Jenova and Sephiroth. The party escapes and 
                Holy is summoned once again, destroying Meteor with help from 
                the Lifestream.[36] Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen 
                with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are 
                now covered in greenery, showing that the planet has healed.

                Initial concept talks for Final Fantasy VII began in 1994 at 
                Square studio, following the completion of Final Fantasy VI. 
                As with the previous installment, series creator Hironobu 
                Sakaguchi reduced his role to producer and granted others a 
                more active role in development: these included 
                Yoshinori Kitase, one of the directors of FFVI. The next 
                installment was planned as a 2D game for Nintendo's 
                Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). 
                After creating an early 2D prototype of it, the team postponed 
                development to help finish Chrono Trigger.[37] 
                Once Chrono Trigger was completed, the team resumed 
                discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995.[37][38] The team 
                discussed continuing the 2D strategy, which would have been the 
                safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry 
                shift toward 3D gaming; such a change would require radical 
                new development models.[37] The team decided to take the 
                riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware 
                but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based
                Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM-based PlayStation from Sony 
                Computer Entertainment.[37] The team also considered the Sega 
                Saturn console and Microsoft Windows.[39] Their decision was 
                influenced by two factors: a highly successful tech demo 
                based on Final Fantasy VI using the new Softimage 3D 
                software, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, 
                which was limiting Square's audience.[37][40][41] Tests were 
                made for a Nintendo 64 version, which would use the planned 
                64DD peripheral despite the lack of 64DD development kits 
                and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. 
                This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 
                polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster placed excessive 
                strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame 
                rate.[37] It would have required an estimated thirty 64DD discs 
                to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression 
                methods of the day.[42] Faced with both technical and economic 
                issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and impressed by the 
                increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the 
                Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of 
                Final Fantasy VII, and all other planned projects, onto the 
                PlayStation.[37] In contrast to the visuals and audio, the 
                overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from 
                Final Fantasy V and VI, but with an emphasis on 
                player control.[43] The initial decision was for battles to 
                feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower 
                polygon count than field areas, which made creating 
                distinctive features more difficult.[40] The summon sequences 
                benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as 
                the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D 
                graphics.[44] In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much 
                of his effort into developing the battle system.[24] He 
                proposed the Materia system as a way to provide more character 
                customization than previous Final Fantasy games: battles no 
                longer revolved around characters with innate skills and roles 
                in battle, as Materia could be reconfigured between battles.[40] 
                Artist Tetsuya Nomura also contributed to the gameplay; he 
                designed the Limit Break system as an evolution of the 
                Desperation Attacks used in Final Fantasy VI. The Limit Breaks 
                served a purpose in gameplay while also evoking each character's
                personality in battle.[24][40] Square retained the 
                passion-based game development approach from their earlier 
                projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create 
                the game they wanted. This was because they had extensive 
                capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant 
                they could focus on quality and scale rather than obsessing 
                over and working around their budget.[37] Final Fantasy VII 
                was at the time one of the most expensive video game projects 
                ever, costing an estimated US$40 million, which adjusted for 
                inflation came to $61 million in 2017.[37][45][46] Development 
                of the final version took a staff of between 100 and 150 
                people just over a year to complete. As video game 
                development teams were usually only 20 people, the game 
                had what was described as the largest development team of
                any game up to that point.[37][44] The development team was 
                split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new 
                American office in Los Angeles; the American team worked
                primarily on city backgrounds.[42]

            <h2>Art design</h2>
            <p>
                The game's art director was Yusuke Naora, who had 
                previously worked as a designer for Final Fantasy VI. 
                With the switch into 3D, Naora realized that he needed to 
                relearn drawing, as 3D visuals require a very different 
                approach than 2D. With the massive scale and scope of the 
                project, Naora was granted a team devoted entirely to the
                game's visual design. The department's duties included 
                illustration, modeling of 3D characters, texturing, the 
                creation of environments, visual effects, and animation.
                [47] The Shinra logo, which incorporated a kanji symbol, 
                was drawn by Naora personally.[48] Promotional artwork, 
                in addition to the logo artwork, was created by Yoshitaka 
                     Amano, an artist whose association with the series went 
                     back to its inception.[49] While he had taken a prominent 
                     role in earlier entries, Amano was unable to do so for
                     Final Fantasy VII, due to commitments at overseas 
                     exhibitions.[8][49] His logo artwork was based on Meteor:
                      when he saw images of Meteor, he was not sure how to turn 
                      it into suitable artwork. In the end, he created multiple
                       variations of the image and asked staff to choose which 
                       they preferred.[50] The green coloring represents the 
                       predominant lighting in Midgar and the color of the 
                       Lifestream, while the blue reflected the ecological 
                       themes present in the story. Its coloring directly 
                       influenced the general coloring of the game's 
                       environments.[47] Another prominent artist was Nomura. 
                       Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, 
                       which were handwritten and illustrated rather than 
                       simply typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main 
                       character designer.[24] Nomura stated that when he was 
                       brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, 
                       but he "went along like, 'I guess first off you need a 
                       hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs 
                       while thinking up details about the characters. After 
                       [he'd] done the hero and heroine, [he] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [he] handed over the designs [he'd] tell people the character details [he'd] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper".
