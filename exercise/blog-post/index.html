                    Super Mario Bros. 3[a] is a 1988 platform game developed 
                    and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment 
                    System (NES). It was released for home consoles in Japan on 
                    October 23, 1988, in North America on February 12, 1990, 
                    and in Europe on August 29, 1991. It was developed by 
                    Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, led by 
                    Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka.

                    Players control brothers Mario or Luigi, who must save 
                    Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven different 
                    kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser. As in previous 
                    Mario games, they defeat enemies by stomping on them or 
                    using items that bestow magical powers; they also have new 
                    abilities, including flight and sliding down slopes. 
                    Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced many elements that became 
                    Super Mario staples, such as Bowser's children 
                    (the Koopalings) and a world map to transition between 
                    levels.
                    
                    Super Mario Bros. 3 was praised by critics for its 
                    challenging gameplay and is regarded as one of the greatest 
                    video games of all time. It is the third-best-selling 
                    NES game, with more than 17 million copies sold worldwide. 
                    It also inspired an animated television series, produced 
                    by DIC Entertainment.

                    Super Mario Bros. 3 is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling 
                    platform game in which the player controls either Mario or 
                    Luigi. The game shares similar gameplay mechanics with 
                    previous games in the series — Super Mario Bros., Super 
                    Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, and Super Mario Bros. 2 —
                    while introducing several new elements. In addition to the 
                    running and jumping found in previous games, the player 
                    character can slide down slopes, pick up and throw certain 
                    items, and freely climb vines. New power-ups are introduced,
                    including the Super Leaf and the Tanooki Suit, which allow 
                    Mario to fly and float.[6] The game world consists of eight 
                    kingdoms, each subdivided into multiple levels. The eight 
                    worlds feature distinct visual themes: the first world is 
                    grass and the second world, "Desert Land" (or "Desert Hill" 
                    in Japanese and North American PRG0 versions), contains 
                    sand-covered levels with pyramids, while the levels in the 
                    fourth world, "Giant Land" ("Big Island"), contain obstacles 
                    and enemies twice their normal height and width.[7]
                    The player navigates through the game via two game screens: 
                    an overworld map and a course. The overworld map displays 
                    an overhead representation of the current kingdom and has 
                    several paths leading from the world's entrance to a 
                    castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, and 
                    other map icons, and allow players to take different routes 
                    to reach the kingdom's goal. Moving the on-screen character 
                    to an action panel or fortress will allow access to that 
                    course, a linear stage populated with obstacles and enemies. 
                    The majority of the game takes place in these levels, with 
                    the player traversing the stage by dashing, jumping, 
                    flying, swimming, and dodging or defeating enemies.[8][9] 
                    Players start with a certain number of lives and may gain 
                    additional lives by picking up green spotted 1-Up mushrooms 
                    hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, among other 
                    methods. Mario and Luigi lose a life if they take damage 
                    while small, fall into lava or a bottomless pit, or run out 
                    of time. The game ends prematurely when all lives are lost, 
                    although the player can continue from the beginning of the 
                    world they lost their last life in by selecting "Continue". 
                    If the player chooses to continue, all fortresses and enemy 
                    courses, as well as the tank and ship levels from the 
                    eighth
                    world that the player previously completed will remain 
                    completed and any locked doors that were unlocked will also 
                    remain unlocked. This allows the player to continue from 
                    the last fortress level they completed in most cases. The 
                    player will also be able to keep all of their items in their 
                    inventory.
                    Completing stages allows the player to progress through 
                    the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world 
                    features a final stage with a boss to defeat. The first 
                    seven worlds feature an airship controlled by one of the 
                    Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle 
                    in the eighth world as the Final Boss. Other map icons 
                    include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths. 
                    Mini-games and bonus screens on the map provide the player 
                    a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. 
                    Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a 
                    reserve, and can be activated by the player from the map 
                    screen.[8][9]
                    In addition to special items from previous games like the 
                    Super Mushroom, Super Star, and the Fire Flower, new 
                    power-ups are introduced that provide the player with 
                    new options. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit give Mario 
                    raccoon and tanooki appearances respectively, allowing him 
                    to fly for a short period of time. The Tanooki Suit also 
                    enables him to turn into Statue Mario to avoid enemies for 
                    a short period of time. Changing into a Tanooki statue 
                    while jumping results in Mario pounding the ground and 
                    killing whatever enemies are directly under him; this is 
                    the first appearance of the now standard "ground pound" 
                    move in the Mario series.[10] The new "Frog Suit" highly 
                    increases the character's underwater speed and agility, 
                    and boosts jumping height on land. Another new suit, the 
                    Hammer Suit, gives Mario the appearance of the Hammer Bro. 
                    enemy and allows him to throw hammers at enemies and resist 
                    fire attacks when crouching.

                    Super Mario Bros. 3 includes a multiplayer option which 
                    allows two players to play the game by taking turns at 
                    navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels. 
                    The first player controls Mario, while the other controls 
                    Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players 
                    can access several mini-games, including a remake of the 
                    original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player has 
                    the opportunity to steal the cards of another, but may lose 
                    their turn if they lose the mini-game.[11]
